Rowy allows users to create a new table from an existing Airtable collection. This is useful if you have a pre-existing data on Airtable and want to import it to Rowy.

### Advantages

Rowy allows a lot of new functionalities that gives you more control over your data. Users can not just view their Firestore data in an Airtable-like UI, but also **build cloud functions**, **automations and workflows** based on their data. **Connect to any third-party tool**, use NPM and APIs right in the browser without the hassle of CLIs, terminals or native consoles.

## Steps

1. After creating a new table, click on the **Import Data** button.

2. Select **Airtable** as the data source.

3. Add the **Airtable API Key** and the **Table URL**. You can find how to generate the [API key](/import-export-data/import-airtable#api-key) and the [Table URL](/import-export-data/import-airtable#table-url) in the sections below.

4. Click on **Continue** to start the import process.

5. Select the columns to be imported to Rowy, click **Continue**.

6. Review the data to be imported and click **Finish**.

## API Key

1. Go to your [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/account) and click on **Generate API key**.

    <img 
        src= {generateAPIKey} 
        alt="Generating an API key"
    />

2. Copy the API key and paste it in the **API Key** field in Rowy.

## Table URL

To extract the **Table URL**, you need to go to the **Airtable collection** you want to import and copy the URL from the browser. The URL is divided into three parts:

- Base (app)
- Table (tbl)
- View (viw)

**NOTE:** The view the user is currently in is the one that will display in the link.

The format for this address will look like this:
<img
    src={tableURL}
    alt="Table URL"
/>

Copy the URL, as shown below, and paste it in the **Table URL** field in Rowy.
<img
    src={copyURL}
    alt="Copy URL"
/>

## Sample Airtable Import

    src={sampleKeys}
    alt="Sample Airtable Import"
/>


## Importing Images from Airtable

Rowy supports importing images directly from Airtable and allows you to store them as a native Image field.

<img src={airtableBase} alt="Airtable Base" />

In the above image, the `assets` column is an **Attachement** type field in our Airtable project, which contains the images.

When we import the data from Airtable using the above steps, we see that the `assets` column is imported as a **JSON** type field in Rowy. This is because as the data is transfered through an API, the **images are stored as JSON objects**. The JSON objects in this field would contain the reference data of the images.
