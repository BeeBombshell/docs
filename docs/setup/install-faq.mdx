## Granting access to Cloud Platform scope via Google Auth and what does it mean for you?

Using this scope, Rowy is will automate the setup of Rowy app end-to-end. 

> **TL;DR:** This saves you the headache of going back and forth to the cloud console for granting various permissions at config level during setup. Rowy is open-source. Your data and code continue to be on your own GCP/Firebase project and will not stored on Rowy end.
> 

The exact services used with this scope during the setup steps include:

- Creation of a new Firebase project with a single click or getting the list of your existing Firebase projects to select from.
- Enable Firebase and Firestore Storage, if it is not already turned on. This is for storing any images or files that you will add to you collections.
- Enable Firebase Authentication, if it is not already turned on. Firebase Auth here will be used for authenticating into the Rowy App.
- Setup the Firebase rules automatically in the case of a new Firebase project.
- For existing Firebase project, Rowy will show you the exact rule snippet that needs to be added. You can do this manually or apply using a single click during onboarding after looking at the rules diff on screen.

Once Rowy setup is complete, you will get a hosted Rowy App URL that you can use to start managing your data tables and invite your team members. With Firebase Auth, only users with specific roles as per the Firestore rules will be able to access the data. Therefore you have full ability to control access permissions at table as well as field level. To learn more about how to Firestore rules and access control work, see this short video.
