The **Multi Select field** allows the user to **select multiple options from a predefined list of options**. 

**For Example:** If you're filling out a survey about your favorite ice cream flavors, you might be asked to select all the flavors you like from a list of options that includes `Chocolate`, `Vanilla`, `Strawberry`, `Mint` etc. With a multi-select field, you can select one, some, or all of these options.
