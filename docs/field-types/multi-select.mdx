The **Multi Select field** allows the user to **select multiple options from a predefined list of options**. 

**For Example:** If you're filling out a survey about your favorite ice cream flavors, you might be asked to select all the flavors you like from a list of options that includes `Chocolate`, `Vanilla`, `Strawberry`, `Mint` etc. With a multi-select field, you can select one, some, or all of these options.

## Using the Multi Select Field

### STEP 1: Creating a Multi Select Column

Create a new column, add a **Column Name** and select **Multi Select** from the **Field Type** dropdown. Click **Next**.
<img src = {multiSelect1} alt-text = "Multi Select Field" />

### STEP 2: Setting Default Values (optional)

You can pick a default value for your Multi Select Column as `undefined`, `null`, set a `static` value from the list of pre-defined values, or write logic to `dynamically` set values depending upon conditions.
<img src = {multiSelect2} alt = "Multi Select selecting default values" />

### STEP 3: Adding Options** 

Click on the **New Option** field and start adding your options. You can also add color coding to your options by clicking on the color picker icon next to the option name. Click **Next**.
<img src = {multiSelect3} alt = "Multi select - adding options" />

### STEP 4: Click on Deploy

Now you can populate your table. It should look something like this:
<img src = {multiSelect4} alt = "Multi Select populated data" />
