## Single Select Field

The single select field allows you to **select a single option from a list of pre-defined options**. 

**For Example:** If you're filling out a form to register for a conference, you might be asked to select your job title from a list of options that includes `Manager`, `Director`, `Engineer`, etc. With a single-select field, you can only select one of these options.
