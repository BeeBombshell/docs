The single select field allows you to **select a single option from a list of pre-defined options**.
<img src = {singleSelect5} alt = "singleSelect5" />

**For Example:** If you're filling out a form to register for a conference, you might be asked to select your job title from a list of options that includes `Manager`, `Director`, `Engineer`, etc. With a single-select field, you can only select one of these options.

### Using the Single Select Field

**STEP 1: Creating a Single Select Column** 

Create a new column, add a **Column Name** and select **Single Select** from the **Field Type** dropdown. Click **Next**.
<img src = {singleSelect1} alt = "singleSelect1" />

**STEP 2: Setting Default Values (optional)** 

You can pick a default value for your Single Select Column as `undefined`, `null`, set a `static` value from the list of pre-defined values, or write logic to `dynamically` set values depending upon conditions.
<img src = {singleSelect2} alt = "singleSelect2" />

**STEP 3: Adding Options** 

Click on the **New Option** field and start adding your options. You can also add color coding to your options by clicking on the color picker icon next to the option name. Click **Next**.
<img src = {singleSelect3} alt = "singleSelect3" />


**STEP 4:** Click on **Deploy**.

Now you can populate your table. It should look something like this:
<img src = {singleSelect4} alt = "singleSelect4" />
