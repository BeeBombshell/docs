Rowy supports various array field types. Let's discuss the different types of array fields and how to use them.

## Array Field

The basic Array Field type is a very flexible array field which let's you store an **array of values**. Rowy Array mimics a **JSON Array** which is a data structure that stores an ordered collection of values in a format known as *JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)*.

We can use the Array Field to store both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous array data. 
### Using Array Field  as a Homogeneous Array
A Homogeneous array is an array that contains only one type of data. So, to use the Array Field type as a Homogeneous array, we can simply choose the only type of data that we want to store in the array.

**For example:** If we want to store an array of strings, we can choose the **Short Text** type in the Array Field side menu.
