Rowy supports various array field types. Let's discuss the different types of array fields and how to use them.

## Array Field

The basic Array Field type is a very flexible array field which let's you store an **array of values**. Rowy Array mimics a **JSON Array** which is a data structure that stores an ordered collection of values in a format known as *JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)*.

We can use the Array Field to store both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous array data. 

### Using Array Field  as a Homogeneous Array
A Homogeneous array is an array that contains only one type of data. So, to use the Array Field type as a Homogeneous array, we can simply choose the only type of data that we want to store in the array.

**For example:** If we want to store an array of strings, we can choose the **Short Text** type in the Array Field side menu.

### Using Array Field as a Heterogeneous Array

A Heterogeneous array is an array that contains multiple types of data. To utilize the Array field as a heterogeneous array, we can add multiple fields to the Array Field side menu.

**For example:** If we want to details of a user in an array, let's say the user's name, age, and location.

So, we can add a **Short Text** field to store the user's name, a **Number** field to store the user's age, and a **Geo Point** field to store the user's location.

## JSON Field

The JSON field is a **JSON Object** which is a data structure that stores an unordered collection of key-value pairs in a format known as *JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)*.

The JSON field can contain a **single JSON object** or an **array of JSON objects** depending upon it's initialization. This allows for flexible data structures that can be used in a variety of ways.

:::tip JSON Field Settings

We can set our JSON field to initialize as an **array of JSON objects** via the JSON Column Config settings. Go to the Column Config settings of the JSON field and select the **Default as Array** option.

### Using JSON Field as a Single JSON Object

To use the JSON field as a single JSON object, we can simply add the key-value pairs that we want to store in the JSON object to the JSON Field side menu or the code-editor available.

**For Example:** Let's add a JSON object that contains three key/value pairs: name, age, and city.

```js
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

### Using JSON Field as an Array of JSON Objects

We can utilize the JSON field to hold an array of JSON objects by enclosing it in square brackets (**[]**) and separating each JSON object with a comma.

**For Example:** We have an array of three JSON objects. Each object contains three key-value pairs: "name", "age", and "city". The objects represent different people with different names, ages, and cities. The entire array is enclosed in square brackets, and each object is separated by a comma.

```js
[  
  {    
    "name": "John Doe",    
    "age": 25,    
    "city": "New York"  
  },  
  {    
    "name": "Regina Philange",    
    "age": 30,    
    "city": "Los Angeles"  
  },  
  {    
    "name": "Ken Adams",    
    "age": 20,    
    "city": "Chicago" 
  }
]
```
