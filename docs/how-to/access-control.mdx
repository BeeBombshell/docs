For all the existing roles in your table, you can setup automated roles for each table in your Workspace directly from your Table Settings.

## Pre-requisites

Follow these steps to enable the automated roles for your table:

**STEP 1:** Go to [IAM and Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) in your GCP Console.

**STEP 4:** Click on the **Save** button to save the changes. You'll need to wait (30 secs to 1 min) for the changes to take effect.

Voila! You're all set to use the automated roles in your table. ðŸš€

## Assigning Automated Roles

Once you've enabled the automated roles, you can assign them to your users in the **Access Control** section of your **Table Settings**.

The Access Control allows the following permissions for each role:

- **View** - Allows the Role to **read the data** in the table.
- **Create** - Allows the Role to **create new records** in the table. (Adding a new row)
- **Delete** - Allows the Role to **delete the data** in the table. (Removing row from the table)
- **Edit** - Allows the Role to **update the data** in the table. (Changing a value in the row)

:::info NOTE
The **ADMIN** and **OWNER** roles are automatically assigned to the users who have access to the table. You can't change the permissions for these roles.
:::

### Example

Let us take an example to understand how we can set up these automated roles.

**EXAMPLE:** Let's set the following automated roles for our table.

- We need the **ADMIN** and **OWNER** role to be able to perform all the actions in the table **by default**, i.e **View**, **Create**, **Delete** and **Edit**.

- The **EDITOR** role to be able to perform the **View**, **Create**, and **Edit** actions in the table.

- The **VIEWER** role to be able to perform the **View** action in the table.

Our table rules would look like this:

- Click on **Update**.

:::info No Need to update the rules manually
There is no need to go to the Firebase console to update the rules. Rowy will automatically update the rules for you.
