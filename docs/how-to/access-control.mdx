For all the existing roles in your table, you can setup automated roles for each table in your Workspace directly from your Table Settings.

**STEP 4:** Click on the **Save** button to save the changes. You'll need to wait (30 secs to 1 min) for the changes to take effect.

Voila! You're all set to use the automated roles in your table. ðŸš€

## Assigning Automated Roles

Once you've enabled the automated roles, you can assign them to your users in the **Access Control** section of your **Table Settings**.

The Access Control allows the following permissions for each role:

- **View** - Allows the Role to **read the data** in the table.
- **Create** - Allows the Role to **create new records** in the table. (Adding a new row)
- **Delete** - Allows the Role to **delete the data** in the table. (Removing row from the table)
- **Edit** - Allows the Role to **update the data** in the table. (Changing a value in the row)
