In order to protect sensitive information such as API keys and Secret keys from being exposed or misused, it is important to securely store them. 

One way to achieve this is by using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager. By adding secrets to GCP Secret Manager, you can easily manage and securely access them when needed.

While writing cloud functions via Derivatives, Extensions, Actions, and Webhooks, you can leverage the GCP Secret Manager to add and utilize secret keys seamlessly.
