Displaying images from Rowy in your FlutterFlow application is a common use case. This guide will show you how to display images from Rowy in your FlutterFlow application.

## Retrieving the Firebase Download URL

<img src = {flutterflow12} alt = "FlutterFlow" />

#### The most common question we get is:

> I am using Rowy as a CMS to manage all the data to be displayed on my FlutterFlow project. But I'm not sure how to make an image appear in FlutterFlow's Photo Path data column.

#### Let us give you a simple solution to this!

As we know, when we upload an image in Rowy, it **gets stored in the Firebase Storage** as an image. We can **extract the Firebase download URL** to display the image in FlutterFlow.

We can use the **Derivative Field** to extract the `downloadURL` derived from an image uploaded in another column. Refer to the following video, or follow the instructions below to see how to get the download URL.

<Video url={videoUrl} playing loop muted playsinline controls />


### Steps

Step 1: Create a **Derivative field** and set the **Listener fields** to be the **Image** column.

Step 2: Change the **Output field** type to `URL`.

Step 3: Set the **Derivative script** to this:
```js
const derivative:Derivative = async ({row,ref,db,storage,auth,logging})=>{
    let url = row.image[0].downloadURL;
    return url;
}

export default derivative;
```

Step 4: Continue to add images and retrieve the URL in the Derivative column.

Now, you can continue to use the derivative column as an Image Path in FlutterFlow.


## Retrieving URL for images in a list

If you need to display a list of images, you can use the **Derivative field** to extract multiple download URLs in form of an JSON array.

<img src = {flutterflow13} alt = "FlutterFlow" />

### Steps

Step 1: Create a **Derivative field** and set the **Listener fields** to be the **Image** column.

Step 2: Change the **Output field** type to `JSON`.

Step 3: Set the **Derivative script** to this:
```js
const derivative:Derivative = async ({row,ref,db,storage,auth,logging})=>{
  // WRITE YOUR CODE ONLY BELOW THIS LINE. DO NOT WRITE CODE/COMMENTS OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION BODY
  const obj = {
    data: []
  }
  row.image.map((img) => {
    obj.data.push(img.downloadURL)
  })
  return obj;
}

export default derivative;
```

**Output:**

<img src = {flutterflow14} alt = "FlutterFlow" />
