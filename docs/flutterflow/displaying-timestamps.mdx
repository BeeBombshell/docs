With Rowy as your low-code / no-code backend, you can easily display timestamps in your FlutterFlow app. This is a great way to show when a user last logged in, or when a post was created.

## Dealing with Firestore Timestamps

<img src = {flutterflow15} alt = "FlutterFlow displaying timestamps" width = "100%" />

While using the **Derivative** field type to get the current timestamp, it is necessary to convert it into the specific format which is required by FlutterFlow. 

In Firestore, the `Timestamp` data type is used to store date and time information. It represents a point in time, independent of any time zone or calendar, as a **Unix timestamp**, which is the **number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC** (also known as the **Unix Epoch**).

> #### For Example:
> `Sunday, 1st January 2023, 12:00:00 AM GMT` is represented as `1672531200000` in Unix timestamp.

When you save a date or time value to Firestore, it is automatically converted to a **Timestamp** object. FlutterFlow accepts the **Timestamp** object as a valid date and time value.

> #### For Example:
> 2023-02-03 23:43:21


## Steps

To create a Derivative function to get a FlutterFlow friendly timestamp, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Create a **Derivative field** and set the **Listener fields** to be any column that would trigger the Derivative.

Step 2: Change the **Output field** type to `Date & Time`.

Step 3: Set the **Derivative script** to this:

```js
const derivative:Derivative = async ({row,ref,db,storage,auth,logging})=>{
  // WRITE YOUR CODE ONLY BELOW THIS LINE. DO NOT WRITE CODE/COMMENTS OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION BODY
  const date = new Date()
  const ms = date.getTime()
  const { Timestamp } = (await (async () => await import("@google-cloud/firestore"))())
  return Timestamp.fromMillis(ms)
  // WRITE YOUR CODE ONLY ABOVE THIS LINE. DO NOT WRITE CODE/COMMENTS OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION BODY
}

export default derivative;
```

Step 4: Set the **Display format** to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` and click **update**.

<img src = {flutterflow16} alt = "Derivative for displaying timestamps" width = "100%" />

#### Output

<img src = {flutterflow17} alt = "Displaying timestamps" width = "50%" />
