Let's set up Rowy and FlutterFlow to build a full stack application. 

To build an end-to-end full stack application, we need to integrate both frontend and backend. The client uses the frontend of the application to communicate with the backend logic.

In todayâ€™s low-code/ no-code world, building full stack applications is as easy as dragging and dropping! ðŸ’ª

Weâ€™d be using:

**FlutterFlow:** As the **frontend**, to build beautiful UI and screens.

**Rowy:** As the **backend**, to build simple yet powerful logic for our app.

## Setting up FlutterFlow with Firebase

Letâ€™s start by [creating an account](https://app.flutterflow.io/create-account) on FlutterFlow, if you already have one, sign in and create a new project.
