Let's set up Rowy and FlutterFlow to build a full stack application. 

To build an end-to-end full stack application, we need to integrate both frontend and backend. The client uses the frontend of the application to communicate with the backend logic.

In today’s low-code/ no-code world, building full stack applications is as easy as dragging and dropping! 💪

We’d be using:

**FlutterFlow:** As the **frontend**, to build beautiful UI and screens.

**Rowy:** As the **backend**, to build simple yet powerful logic for our app.

## Setting up FlutterFlow with Firebase

Let’s start by [creating an account](https://app.flutterflow.io/create-account) on FlutterFlow, if you already have one, sign in and create a new project.

### Project Setup Modal #1

- Click on **create a new app** and give it a name. 

- You can change the Package Name as you like. (although it is optional) 

- Toggle the **Setup Firebase** button to integrate Firebase Setup for your FlutterFlow Application.

- Click on the **Next Step** button.

### Project Setup Modal #2

- To retrieve your Firebase Project ID goto [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

- Sign in with your Google Account. 

- Select an existing project or Create a new Project. Follow the steps given below to set up your Firebase Project. (New Project or Existing)

#### Creating a new Firebase Project

- Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

- Click on **Add project**.

- Enter a **Project Name**, and click **Continue**.

- You can enable Google Analytics for the project. If you want to enable Google Analytics, then you will be prompted to select a Google Analytics account on the next screen. (This is optional)

- Click **Create project**. Once the project is completed, select **Continue**.

##### ENABLE FLUTTERFLOW ACCESS TO YOUR FIREBASE PROJECT

- In the Firebase dashboard of your project, navigate to the far left menu. Select **Project Settings** → **Users and Permissions**.

- Select **Add Member**.

- Add `firebase@flutterflow.io` as an "**Editor**" for your project and select **Done**. Then select **Add Member**.

<img src={flutterflow5} alt="FlutterFlow" width="100%" />

- On the same page (i.e. Users and Permissions page), select **Advanced Permission Settings** (small blue text below the table). This will open the Google console (Google Cloud Platform) in a new browser window.

- Find the row containing `firebase@flutterflow.io` and select **Edit Member** (pencil on the far right of the row).

- Select **+ Add Another Role**.

- Under **Select A Role**, search for `Cloud Functions Admin` and select it.

- Under **Select A Role**, search for `Service Account User` (you may need to scroll to find this) and select this as well.

- Select **Save**.

#### CONFIGURING THE FIRESTORE DATABASE

Configuring the Firestore Database would help you create collections and add documents directly from FlutterFlow.

- From the Firebase dashboard of your project, navigate to the far left menu. Select **Firestore Database** and then select **Create Database**.

- Next, you will need to set your Firebase security rules. To get started quickly you can select **Start in test mode** and select **Next**.

:::info  Firestore security rules
Please see [this link](https://docs.flutterflow.io/data-and-backend/firebase/firestore-database/firestore-rules) for additional information on Firestore security rules.
:::

- Next, you will need to choose the location where your Firestore data will be stored. From the dropdown, select a location and then select **Enable**.

:::info  Firestore locations
Please see [this link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations?authuser=0) for additional information on Firebase locations.

#### ENABLE BILLING (REQUIRED FOR ROWY RUN)

Before starting, make sure you have your Google Cloud or Firebase project with **Firestore** and **Firebase Authentication enabled**, and upgraded to the **Blaze Plan**.

You can upgrade to the Blaze pricing plan in the Firebase console. A Cloud Billing account is essentially being added to the your Google Cloud project when you upgrade to the Blaze pricing plan.

- Login to your Firebase Console. On the lower left corner, your project will be listed to be on the **Spark Plan**. Click on the **Upgrade** button.
    <img src={flutterflow7} alt="FlutterFlow" width="100%" />

- Select the **Blaze Plan** and click on the **Upgrade** button.
    <img src={flutterflow8} alt="FlutterFlow" width="100%" />

- Select a **billing account**. Then click **Continue and Purchase**. You are now on the **Blaze plan**.

:::info  Firebase Billing Instructions
For more information on setting up the billing account, check out the Google Billing Instructions [here](https://docs.firerun.io/getting-started/creating-a-google-billing-account-for-firebase).

#### COPY PROJECT ID TO FLUTTERFLOW

- Now, from your project in the **Firebase Console**, navigate to the far left menu. Click on the **settings icon** next to the Project Overview. Select the **Project Settings**.

- Under the **Project Settings**, copy the **Project ID**.

- Return to the FlutterFlow Screen and paste the **Project ID**. Click on **Connect**.

<img src={flutterflow10} alt="FlutterFlow" width="100%" />


#### GENERATING CONFIG FILES

- In FlutterFlow, click on **Auto Generate Config Files**.

<img src={flutterflow11} alt="FlutterFlow" width="100%" />

:::note For Existing FlutterFlow Projects
If you have already created a project in FlutterFlow, Go to the **Settings & Integrations** > **Project Setup** > **Firebase**, make sure you have pasted the project ID and then click on **Auto Generate Config Files**.
:::

#### FINISHING THE SETUP

- Turn on the **Enable Authentication** to allow users to log into your app using Firebase Authentication. Please note this step only enables Authentication. You will need to complete an additional setup using [these instructions](https://docs.flutterflow.io/data-and-backend/firebase/authentication).

- Turn on **Create User Collection** to Automatically add a **users** collection to [Firestore Database](https://docs.flutterflow.io/data-and-backend/firebase/firestore-database). This collection will be used to store logged-in user's details such as email and password.

- **Select Initial Pages** allows you to define the first page a user sees when they open the app and the first page they see after logging in. When you click **Unset** you will be able to choose from a list of templates. You can change these pages at any time inside the [App Details](https://docs.flutterflow.io/settings-and-integrations/general-settings/app-details#initial-page) page.

- Click on **Start Building**.


## Setting up with an existing FlutterFlow Project

Follow the same steps as in “**Creating a new Firebase Project**”  from enabling FlutterFlow access to the project.

The final step is **connecting** and **autogenerating the config files**.

To connect and autogenerate files:

- From the Firebase dashboard from your project, navigate to the far left menu. Select **Project Settings**.

- Under Your Project, look for **Project ID**. Right-click and copy it.

- Return to [FlutterFlow](https://app.flutterflow.io/). From the Navigation Bar, select **Settings & Integrations** > **Project Setup** > **Firebase**.

- Add your **Firebase Project ID** and click **Connect**. A green check ✅ will appear once this is complete.

- Under **Config Files**, select **Autogenerate Files** and then select **Generate Files**.
