Manage your FlutterFlow Map Arrays better with the [Array Sub-table](../../field-types/array-subtable) field in Rowy.

Using JSON fields to store Map Arrays can be difficult to manage and manipulate.

Instead of using the JSON field to store your Map Arrays, you can now use the Array Sub-table field to store your Map Arrays in a more structured way.

With the Array Sub-table feature, you can now easily manage and manipulate array data without running into issues like changing schema declaration types or breaking your FlutterFlow applications.
