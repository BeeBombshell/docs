Manage your FlutterFlow Map Arrays better with the [Array Sub-table](../../field-types/array-subtable) field in Rowy.

Using JSON fields to store Map Arrays can be difficult to manage and manipulate.

Instead of using the JSON field to store your Map Arrays, you can now use the Array Sub-table field to store your Map Arrays in a more structured way.

With the Array Sub-table feature, you can now easily manage and manipulate array data without running into issues like changing schema declaration types or breaking your FlutterFlow applications.

## Example

Let's say you're building a web application for a Library, and you need to keep track of all the books in the Library's collection. 

Each book has a title, author, publication date, and a list of borrowing records that includes the borrower's name, the date borrowed, and the date returned. You could store this data as follows:

In this example, each book is represented as a document in the "books" collection, with fields for the book's title, author, and publication date.

Each book also has a Array in the form of a Sub-table called "borrowingRecords", which contains a list of JSON objects for each borrowing record. Each borrowing record contains the fields for that record, including the borrower's name, date borrowed, and date returned.
