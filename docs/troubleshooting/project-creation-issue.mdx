## Error: Key creation is not allowed on this service account.

Your organisation has restricted the creation of service account keys. It is a requirement for Rowy to create service account keys in your project. To continue, you will need to disable this restriction.

In GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/iam-disableServiceAccountKeyCreation), if the policy is enforced, set it to not enforced.

Once the policy is set to not enforced, you can try again in Rowy app.
<img src={orgPolicyOff} alt="AppCheck 2" width={200} />
