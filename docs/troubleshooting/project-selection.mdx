If you encounter issues while trying to select an existing project from the **Create a Project** dropdown menu in Rowy, you can follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

## Step 1: Remove Rowy's permissions from your Google account

On your browser, navigate to [this page](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Fsecurity). 
This page allows you to manage the permissions associated with your Google account. Remove the permissions for Rowy by clicking on the **Rowy** entry and then clicking on **Remove Access**.

## Step 3: Log back in to Rowy

Now, go back to Rowy and try to re-authenticate. It is recommended to use the **Chrome browser** for this step, as **Safari** may have caching issues that prevent proper re-authentication.


By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to successfully select an existing project from the dropdown menu in Rowy. ðŸš€
