Logging is an essential part of debugging and monitoring code. Rowy provides accessible **build**, **runtime**, and **audit logs** for all the cloud functions in a table.

Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows the user to analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events from Firebase projects.

## Types of Logging Messages

Rowy **Logging** utilizes the Cloud Functions `Logger` SDK. Rowy **Logging** provides a standard interface that has a similar api to `console.log` statements and supports other log levels such as: 

- `log`: The **log** method is used to log a message for a specific cloud function. This can be used in a cloud function as:
    ```js
    logging.log("This is a logging message!")
    ```

- `warn`: The **warn** method is used to pass **warning** type log messages. A warning may occur whenever a user has given a wrong or undesired input. The **warn** log can be used in any cloud function as follows:
    ```js
    logging.warn("This is a warning message!")
    ```

- `error`: The **error** method helps log critical errors that are being encountered by the cloud function while being executed. Error logs can be used for catching and correcting these failures. The **error** log can be used as:
    ```js
    logging.error("This is an error message!")

While creating a Rowy project, cloud logs can come really handy to thoroughly examine changes during deployment. 

To access the Rowy Cloud Logs, navigate to the menu on the top right corner of your project table. Locate and click the **Cloud Logs** button.

This fires up the **Cloud Logs Interface**, wherein you can access the logs categorized as follows:

### Build Logs
Build logs are enhanced console outputs of builds. They are represented by a structured list of the events which took place during the respective build.

### Audit Logs
Audit logs are used to document activity within the software systems of your Rowy project.

### Function Logs
Function logs allow us to monitor and analyze the whereabouts of functions used in a Rowy project.

### Webhook Logs
Webhook logs include a record of every webhook atempt that our project makes. Additionally, they document the information on the success or failure of each webhook call.
