With Rowy, you can set the display names and the database field key seperately.

When you create a new column, in the pop-up modal you'll be able to see a **Column Name** and a **Field Key**.

- **Column Name** is the name of the column that will be displayed in the table.
- **Field Key** is the name of the column in the database.

## Column Name

The **Column Name** is the **title of the column** that will be displayed in the table. The column names are just **for display** and **can be changed at any time**.

## Field Key

The **Field Key** is how the column is stored in the database. The field key is automatically generated as the **Column Name in Camel Case**, but you can change it at the time of column creation.

:::tip Map your existing data via Field Key
If you have pre-existing data in your database, you can use the **Field Key** to map the data to the correct column.

**For Example:** If you have a existing data in your collection with a field key of, let's say `Firstname`, you can map the data to the column by setting the **Field Key** to `Firstname` when you create it.

:::tip Copying your Field Keys

You can simply hover over the column or simply click on it, you'll be able to copy the underlying **Field Key** to your clipboard.

### Field Key in the database

If you go to the database by clicking on the **Document Path** available in the side panel, you'll be redirected to the location of that document in the database.

Here, you can see the **Field Key** of the column stored in the database.
