With Rowy, you can set the display names and the database field key seperately.

When you create a new column, in the pop-up modal you'll be able to see a **Column Name** and a **Field Key**.

## Column Name

The **Column Name** is the **title of the column** that will be displayed in the table. The column names are just **for display** and **can be changed at any time**.
