Now you can easily link your Rowy table data to your API built on BuildShip.

Trigger your backend API call every time you create, update, or delete a field
in your Rowy table. This has been made possible with the ‚Äú**BuildShip
Extension**‚Äù.

With the BuildShip Extension, you can effortlessly connect your Rowy Table to
your backend workflows on BuildShip.

This is all you need to do in BuildShip to set up the Rowy Trigger. Now, let's
set up the BuildShip Extension our Rowy Table.

## Setting up the Extension in Rowy

- In your Rowy Table, access the extensions menu and add a "**BuildShip Trigger
  Extension**".

<img src={buildship4} alt="buildship rowy trigger" />

- **Select Trigger Events** within Rowy that will trigger the BuildShip
  extension. You can select from events:
  - `Create`
  - `Update`
  - `Delete`

<img src={buildship3} alt="buildship rowy trigger" />

- Optionally, you can **define the required fields** that must be populated to
  trigger the extension.

- If needed, **add conditions** that determine whether the extension should be
  triggered for a given row.

- Within the extension body, navigate to the return statement. Fnd the
  `buildshipConfig` object, which includes the following fields:

```js
buildshipConfig: {
      projectId: "",
      workflowId: ""
}
```

- Replace the placeholder with the configuration details copied from your
  BuildShip Rowy Trigger. It should look something like this:

```js
buildshipConfig: {
  projectId: "buildship-008vd0",
  workflowId: "zE49cCs5kBmg7GkUwzLt"
}
```

<img src={buildship6} alt="buildship rowy trigger" />

- Once you've configured the extension to your requirements, click on "**Add**"
  and then deploy the extension.

Now, whenever the selected event (Create, Update, or Delete) occurs in your Rowy
Table, it will trigger the BuildShip workflow linked to this extension.

BuildShip showcases a wide range of pre-built templates that you can easily
clone and use for your own projects. You can also build your own custom
workflows from scratch. Leverage this powerful duo for your projects and tell us
what you think!
