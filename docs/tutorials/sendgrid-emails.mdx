## Setting up in Sendgrid

1. Sign up for a Sendgrid account and enable Two-Factor Authentication when prompted.

2. Create a sender identity by clicking on "Create Identity" and provide the required details. Verify the identity through email.

3. Integrate Sendgrid using the Web API and select Node.js as the language.

4. Generate an API Key in Sendgrid and make sure to copy and temporarily store it.

5. Go to the GCP Secret Manager and set up a secret named sendgrid with the API Key as the body content.

6. In Sendgrid's Design Library, either select an email template or create your own. Save the template.

7. In the tags section, add any relevant tags to the email content.

8. Optionally, test the email template by providing test data in JSON format in the Test Data section.

9. Under the Email API tab, navigate to Dynamic Templates and create a new dynamic template. Provide a name and select a version based on your drafted design. Save the template and copy the template ID.
